                    <br/></h4>


                <p><img src="assets/img/roses.jpeg" id="about"/> Mickey Mouse turns 80 years old today, and there's not
                    a gray
                    hair on
                    him. Sure, he's a little rounder, a little
                    squatter, and he's been wearing the same clothes for decades, but all in all he looks pretty good. Sure,
                    Mickey
                    hasn't had a movie in two years (his last one went direct-to-video), but his cheerful face remains one
                    of the
                    most recognizable images in the world, even beating out Santa Claus. Disney threw a big party for the
                    mouse's
                    75th birthday, so this year's festivities will be comparatively subdued. </p>
                <p>In 1935, a young animator named Fred Moore gave Mickey his first makeover. Earlier animators had drawn
                    the mouse
                    as a series of circles, which limited his movement.</p>
                <p>Moore — who later animated Fantasia's Sorcerer's Apprentice segment — gave him a pear-shaped body,
                    pupils, white
                    gloves and a shortened nose, to make him cuter.</p>
